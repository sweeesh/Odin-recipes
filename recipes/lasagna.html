<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish made with alternating layers of wide, flat pasta noodles, a tomato-based sauce, and a variety of ingredients, typically including cheese, meat, and vegetables. The pasta is often layered with a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan cheeses, along with seasoned ground beef or Italian sausage and sautéed vegetables like onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms. Some variations of lasagna can include other ingredients like spinach or eggplant, and can be made with either a meat sauce or a vegetarian tomato sauce. Once assembled, the dish is typically baked in the oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges are crispy</p>
